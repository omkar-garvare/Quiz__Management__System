# Quiz__Management__System
Quiz__Management__System is a Web application. In this project I have used Java language for front-end development and for back-end operations MySQL used.
This project is mainly divided into two modules, student and admin.
Student is able to only fill registration form and submit the quiz. At the end of quiz result get displayed.
Admin able to add new questions, update  questions, delete questions, etc.
This is very interesting web application. I mainly used used Java applets and Jswing for making GUI attractive.
